theorem {t ∈ a : P(t)} ∩ {t ∈ a : Q(t)} = {t ∈ a : P(t) ∧ Q(t)}
proof
    take a;
    we have p such as p = {t ∈ a : P(t)};
    we have q such as q = {t ∈ a : Q(t)};
    we have r such as r = {t ∈ a : P(t) ∧ Q(t)};

    k ∈ p ∩ q ⟷ k ∈({t ∈ a : P(t)} ∩ {t ∈ a : Q(t)});
    k ∈ p ∩ q ⟷ (k ∈ a ∧ P(k)) ∧ (k ∈ a ∧ Q(k));
    k ∈ p ∩ q ⟷ k ∈ a ∧ (P(k) ∧ Q(k));
    k ∈ p ∩ q ⟷ k ∈ {t ∈ a : P(t) ∧ Q(t)};
    k ∈ p ∩ q ⟷ k ∈ r;
    p ∩ q = r;
    then {t ∈ a : P(t)} ∩ {t ∈ a : Q(t)} = {t ∈ a : P(t) ∧ Q(t)}
